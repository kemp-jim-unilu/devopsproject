# Scenario 1:
In this scenario we will create a failing testing and see that the pipeline fails.

Open ./original_e4l/.gitlab-ci.yml and for the job dummy test change the script from exit 0 to exit 1.
This will simulate a failing test.
After editing the file goto ./original_e4l and run:
git add .gitlab-ci.yml
git commit -m "ci"
git push http://user:us3rus3r@192.168.56.9/gitlab/user/e4l
The changes have now been pushed.
On the gitlab page, go to pipelines and the pipeline should now fail at the test stage.

# Scenario 2:
In this scenario we will change a string in the frontend and then see the changes in production.

Open with a text editor the file ./original_e4l/lu.uni.e4l.platform.frontend.dev/src/public/language/en.json
On line 5 add some string in front of "Here you can calculate your own personal energy..."
Commit again as describe in scenario 1.
Observe the pipeline on the gitlab server, it should suceed.
Check the website on http://192.168.56.9:8884/
The change should be visible.
